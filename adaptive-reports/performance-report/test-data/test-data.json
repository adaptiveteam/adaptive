I will leave coaching to the coaching survey.  I jest about the newscaster/speculation -but your communication of all things factual, hopeful, and speculative was very helpful, and as this is part of your role, I am completely satisfied.  You were also very responsive in regards to new bot development and guiding us to appropriate venues for bug report, or helping to unstick blocked/stuck things.  I suppose one might say you are the oil for the engine.  ",
