# Introduction
The following are features we look for in feedback to find ways in which we can help employees write better feedback. As we detect these features in feedback provided by a user, our goal is to coach the individual in the moment to help them improve that feedback if possible. For each feature we find, we list different response options designed to coach the user on how to supply better feedback. Should we find an opportunity, we will choose one of the possible answers at random.
Features
## Personal Feedback
Personal feedback has pronouns that refer to a person. For example, me, you, I, we, are all example. The intent is to strengthen the social network by humanizing those for whom the author is writing the feedback and to help the reader appreciate that a human wrote it.
### Trigger
No pronouns in feedback
### Response Options
1.	How could you help your colleague understand how their performance changed you personally? Help them understand your thinking.
1.	It is important that people understand how their performance changes your performance. Can you share that with your colleague?
1.	Your opinion and thoughts are important to share with your colleague. How did their performance impact you personally?

## Actionable
Actionable feedback has a lot of verbs (more than 3), adverbs (at least one) or adjectives (at least one).  The intent is to encourage feedback authors to write actionable feedback, something that the reader can do, or actions to which they can relate.
### Trigger
Less than three verbs, and more than one adjective or adverb.
### Response Options
1. Could this text be more actionable? Let your colleagues know what you think they should do.
1. Clear, actionable coaching is the most effective coaching. Explain to your colleague eactly what they should do.
1. Can you be more explicit what your colleague can do to improve your confidence in them?

## Words to Avoid
There are certain words that you should avoid when writing feedback. These words often undo something that was just said.
### Trigger
Anytime the user uses any of these words -
1. but
1. however
1. unfortunately
1. although
1. never
### Response Options
1. I see some words in this that can subvert your intention.  Avoid words like no, but, however, etc.
1. When you say \"no\", \"but\", or \"however\" you can undermine good intentions.  Try to avoid words like these.
1. Words like \"no\", \"but\", or \"however\" are often unnecessary and better left out.

## Irony
Irony is never a good thing to try when writing feedback because it can be easily misinterpretted.  Then intent is to detect ironic sentences and redirect the author down a more productive path.
### Trigger
Detecting irony is very hard for computers and we've set the confidence interval to 90 or above meaning that the irony is so obvious a computer was able to detect it. 
### Response Options
1. This text looks like it may contain some irony. This can often be miscontrued in written feedback.
1. Irony doesn't often translate well in written form.  Could this text contain irony?
1. I am a computer so it is hard for me to tell but is there irony in this text? If so consider removing it.

## Subjective
Subjective feedback appears to drive stronger performance improvement in 360 degree feedback, perhaps because it creates empathy, humanizes colleagues, all of which leads to a stronger social network.
### Trigger
Purely objective feedback
### Response Options
1. Facts matter and so does your opinion.  Feel free to share your opinions with your colleagues about how they can level up their performance.
1. Highly effective team members care about each other's opinions.  Feel free to share yours.
1. Create empathy by letting your colleagues know your opinions about how they can strengthen your confidence in them.

## Sentiment
The sentiment of a statement is how positive or negative the text can be read.  "I hate you" is clearly negative. "I love you" is clearly positive. Positive sentiment is correlated with stronger performance improvement and is generally considered best practice.
### Trigger
Feedback that is neutral, negative, or strongly negative.
### Response Options
#### Neutral or None
1. This looks rather neutral to me.  Positive feedback drives stronger improvements.
1. I wonder if you could rewrite this to be more positive?
1. Consider adding a positive spin to this in order to get a better reaction.
#### Negative
1. This has a bit of a negative feel to it. Putting a positive spin on it could yield better results.
1. This could achieve better results if it was more positive.  Think about how you an do that.
1. Negative feedback can be counter productive. How could you make this more positive?
#### Very Negative
1. Wow, this looks very negative to me. Making it more positive could have a better impact.
1. Gosh, I wonder if this is as negative as I think it is. Consider rewriting this to make it more positive.
1. I am concerned that this is very negative. Positive feedback yields better results.

## Polarity Conflict
A polarity conflict is one feedback contains both positive and neutral sentiment.  For example, the feedbackl "I love you and I hate you" contains two conflicting polarities.  This can create confusion and water down positive sentiment.  It is better to rewrite the feedback so that it is consistently positive.
### Trigger
Conflicting sentiment polarity.
### Response Options
1. It looks like there are some inconsitencies in the sentiment for different parts of this text.  Consider rewriting is so that there is no confusion.
1. I wonder if there are both positive and negative statements in this text? Can you rewrite this to remove any confusion
1. Clearly positive statements drive greater outcomes in performance. It looks like there may be some confusion about the sentiment of this text.

## Too short
Feedback that is too short can make it difficult to come up with a response from the reader, their coach, and the natural language analyses we run.
### Trigger
Feedback that is less than 20 words.
### Response Options
1. This looks a little short to me.  Make sure you provide enough content to be meaningful.
1. If you really want to help your colleagues them give them enough feedback to be meaningful.
1. I wonder if you can expand on this? It looks a little light.

## Too long
Feedback that is too long may turn off the reader and they end up skipping some or all of it.
### Trigger
Feedback that is greater than 50 words.
### Response Options
1. Wow! This is a lot of content. People will be more inclined to read it if it was a little shorter.
1. You spend a lot of time thinking about this! I wonder if you can tighten it up a bit to be shorter?
1. People tend to read feedback that is concise.  Can you tighen this up a bit?

## Upper Case Words
All upper case words can be a bit jarring to the reader.  Sometimes this is good if the user is trying to communicate a lot of energy or emotion. The intention might be good or bad. However, it is often safer to replace all upper case wording with proper punctuation like an exclamation mark.
### Trigger
Words that are ALL CAPS
### Response Options
1. All caps words can be a little jarring. Consider rewriting this using punctuation to get your point across.
1. It looks like you included some words in ALL CAPS.  It is usually safer to just use punctuation.
1. I appreciate the enthusiam but all caps words are probably best left out of your feedback.  Consider rewriting this.
