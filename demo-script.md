# Pre-Demo Checklist
   - Clear data from previous demos (engagements, user feedback, objectives, progress and reports)
   - Delete any previously used community channels
   - Creates
     - Admin channel
     - Adaptive User Channel
     - Coaching Channel
     - HR Channel
   - Invite
     - Chris to the HR community channel
     - Sunny to the User Community
   - Get content to paste in ready
   - Arrange Slack client window to the left and Slack browser client to the right
   - HR should say `@adaptive hi` 5 times so that he can rapidly simulate each event

# Demo Setup
  - _Walk through Demo Prep Deck_
  - _Switch to Coach’s screen with the Slack client window and Slack browser window_

_The way this script works is that there will be one person talking, and another person working with the bot.  The actions to be taken during the demo will be italisized bullets.  The normal text is the script._

# Script 
On the left side of the screen you will see coach. On the right side is coachee. 

## Setup

The first thing to know is that, to Adaptive, any channel can be converted into communities of people that can work together to drive strategic change.

You can see here that we’ve already created channels to represent each of the kinds of communities that you can super charge with Adaptive including.

  * _Show the channels and their membership_

Note that these can be pre-existing channels that already have people in them. For instance, you can see that the Adaptive-User channel has Coach and HR, The Adaptive-Coaching channel has Coach in it. Finally, notice that the Admin channel only has HR in it.

To convert any channel in Slack into an Adaptive powered community, just invite the Adaptive bot. Let’s invite Adaptive to the Admin community to see what happens.

  * _Invite Adaptive to the Admin Community Channel_
  * _Select the pull-down box and pause to show everyone the options_

You can see here all the communities that Adaptive currently knows about and can support.
  
  * _Select Admin_

 Notice that Adaptive has sent Coach a direct message. Let’s see what it says.

  * _Switch to the Adaptive direct message channel_

What you see here are all the things you can now do with Adaptive by just being a member of that channel. This is how we allocate functionality to different users and control security.

  * _Coach switches back to the Admin channel to set up the next engagement_

So what happens when someone tries to interact with Adaptive and they aren't a member of any community?  Let's have Coachee try that and see what happens.

  * _Coachee says "hi" to Adaptive_
  * _Pause to show the response_

You can see that Adaptive offers to contact the Admin channel for an invitation.  Let's do that.

  * _Direct Adaptive to contact the Admin community_
  
Now you can see over in HR's window that an invitation request has come to the Admin channel.  Let's invite Coachee.

  * _HR invites Sunny_
  
You can see in Coachee's window that he now has permissions to interact with Adaptive as a user.  Notice that Adaptive asks Coachee when he would like to meet. This is our way of reducing distractions. Most bots don't care what time of the day it is, they just message you.  This can be very distracting and so we've designed Adaptive to send primary scheduled messages as opposed to always real-time. This also gives users the time they need to think and collaborate in the most effective say. You will see this effect later.

Now let's see what happens when Sunny says "hi" again.

  * _Coachee says "hi" again and now Adaptive is responsive._
 
Let's set up the other channels.

  * _Coach invites Adaptive to_
    * HR Community Channel
    * Coaching Community Channel

HR channel members can see feedback data for any user as well as summary reports.  The coaching channel members can support coaching activity.

## Schedule

One of the most powerful aspect of Adaptive is that it can orchstrate complex collaboration across the entire enterprise. So, instead of asking Adaptive members to remember or learn anything, Adaptive will instead come to each user and guide them through every interaction, coaching them along the way about how to be a great team member.

Every Adaptive user can see the schedule of upcoming events. Let's see what that looks like.

  * _Coachee shows the schedule for the next 90 days_
  
Here you can see the dozens of different collaboration events that Adaptive will orchestrate for us. Instead of asking a project manager to handle all of this, Adaptive will handle it.

One of the things we can do as an Adaptive Admin is to time travel to test out the system.  We are going to do that here so that we can simulate what it would be like to work with Adaptive over the course of the quarter.

Let's pretend that it is at the beginning of the quarter, specifically April 15. So, on April 15, Adaptive will check to make sure that everyone has a individual development objective they've created to drive the company strategy.
  * _Chris simulates April 15 for Coachee._

## Individual Development Objectives

You can see that Adaptive reached out to Coachee as through it were April 15 asking him if he has any IDO's to create. Let's see what creating a IDO looks like.

  * _Coachee creates an IDO_

Here you see that this is where we can align individuals to the strategy. We can choose individual initiatives or any of the objectives to which those initiatives are aligned.

When creating the objective, we can choose not to have a coach, select a specific coach or have an open coaching request. For the demo, let's choose open coaching request.

Notice that there is a new reply to this objective and the bar to the left went from blue to red. That is because for all written input, users get their own language coach.

All of the the guidance you see here on how to write a great objective was written by an award winning speech therapist and reviewed by a psychologist.  In this way we can coach everyone on how to collaborate more effectively.

  * _Coachee modifies the description to get to green._

Switch to coaching community
  - There should be an engagement about Coachee looking for a coach for his objective
  - Coach decides to accept that
  - A notification will be posted to the channel and another notification will be posted to Coachee

Switch back to Coach
  - The next date,  on April 22, is for Adaptive to check for updates to personal improvement objectives.
  - Adaptive will come to you and ask you for an update to your personal improvement objectives
  - From the HR community, HR simulates April 22 for Coachee
  (Please note that Coachee has created an objective but did not add any progress yet)
  - On simulating the above date, an engagement will be sent to Coachee

# Coaching

Switch to Coachee
  - Notice that Adaptive has now come to Coachee to ask for an update.  So as opposed to some manager being a nag, Adaptive has taken over this work.
  - Show Coachee updating the  issue. This update will be sent as an non-urgent engagement to Coach

Switch to Coach
  - Indicate that users can also engage with Adaptive on-demand
  - Ask for engagements for the day
  - Review progress comments from Coachee
  - Show the example of how one word can affect the way in which feedback can be perceived negatively, even when it could have been unintentional. Adaptive coaches you to make it right.

Switch to Coachee
  - Ask for engagements for the days
  - Mark comments from coach as read

Switch to Coach
  - Now we are going to fast forward towards the end of the quarter to simulate June 21.  If users have IDO that are still open the platform will ask them to consider closing them.

Switch to Coachee
  Show him closing out the IDO.

Switch to Coach
  Show him approving the closeout

Coaching feedback:
Switch to Coach
  - Next is June 24th, first reminder to provide feedback
  - Simulate June 24th for Coach. Adaptive should ask Coach if he wants to give feedback. This is the way in which Adaptive reaches out to users to provide feedback
  - Indicate that users can get more information about each of the dimensions by clicking on `Learn more` that takes them to Adaptive documentation
  - Bharth provides feedback to Coachee
    
```
  Contribution (yellow)
    - I’ve noticed that you struggled to manage your time for the last 3 tasks. It impacted the rest of the team because they were waiting for some parts of the project from you. We can figure it out, but let’s make sure you’re set up to optimize your time going forward.
    - (also add this)
    Instead of just planning for the coming weeks, maybe you can make a point of planning your time day-to-day as well. I’ll set up 15-minute meetings in the morning so we can all share what we’re working on and what we got done the day before.
    
    Skill (green)
    - One of your most impactful moments were the insights you gleaned based on Project X. It showed the power of user testing in shaping a feature roadmap and increases the likelihood that we satisfy and delight our users. I'd love to see you do more of this. Something I really appreciate about you is your aptitude for problem-solving in a proactive way.

    Reliability:
    - (yellow)
      You haven't kept your promises. You always guaranteed that deadlines will be met but constantly missed them.
    - (green)
      You were loaded with requests from multiple sources and much-unplanned work accumulated on your plate which, I believe, was the primary reason for your missing deadlines. A good habit is to focus on one at a time.

    Productivity (green)
    - Seriously, great job with your goals this quarter. You accomplished a lot, and it’s okay that you didn’t hit every single goal, but I can see that it’s taking away a bit from your sense of achievement.
    I think your goals might be too aggressive. Maybe you can try setting fewer big goals and more small goals or narrowing your goals down a bit to make them more attainable and measurable.
```

Switch to Coachee
  - Show how Coachee can request feedback from Coach

So, in addition to orchestrating the collaboration between coach and coachee, Adaptive will also fan out across the company towards the end of each quarter to collect 360 degree feedback for all Adaptive users.

Adaptive also generates summary reports towards the end of the quarter.

Switch to Coach
  - Simulate July 12th which is the next quarter for Coachee. Reports for a quarter are sent to users by second week of the next quarter.

Switch to Coachee:
  - Coachee should get an engagement to review the report
  - Go through the contents of the report, specifically coaching ideas
  
# Strategy

  - _Return to Demo Prep Deck and show the strategy diagram_

This coaching dynamic extends to the strategy.  Adaptive will ask the initiative advocate for a weekly update which will go to all of the objective advocates to which the initiative is aligned.  The objective advocate will then be afforded an opportunity to respond.  Finally, Adaptive will ask the objective advocate for a monthly update which will go to the advocate fo rthe mission & vision for the company, typically the CEO.
